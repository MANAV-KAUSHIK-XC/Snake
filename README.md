Snake.py has the barebones of a working Snake game. It creates the map using the map file.
A '#' in the mapfile represents the wall, an 'a' represents the first position of the apple(or food whatever you call it), an 's' represents the starting position of the Snake. If 'a' and 's' are not present in the file, they will be given random positions.
You can denote empty spaces in the map by a ' '(space), however, some text editors omit trailing spaces, so I would recomment using any character other than '#', 'a' and 's' if you dont get the desired result.
